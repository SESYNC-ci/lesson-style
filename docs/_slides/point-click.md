## Point-and-click interface
SESYNC's Jupyter Lab server has the [JupyterLab git extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git#readme) enabled. The extension is a user-friendly add-on for JupyterLab that lets you do basic git actions with a point-and-click interface. Access the extension by simply clicking on the git icon on the left-hand side of your screen in Jupyter Lab (you should see something like the screenshot below).
